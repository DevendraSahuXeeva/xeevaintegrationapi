# Xeeva Integration Services

At Xeeva, Our vision is to harmonize business commerce. We believe passionately in delivering immediate and sustainable results to our clients. We’re excited to build a relationship with you, learn about your procurement and sourcing challenges, and provide you with a solution that will actually drive results for your business. In the same regards, Xeeva Integration service is implemented on Integration platform as a service (iPaaS) to provide phenomenal flexibility. 

## Overview

### Basics

Xeeva can integrate with limitless types of software applications, from financial and ERP to HR, to inventory management.        
 
So, if you've got a preference or standard, we can leverage our Web API to hook directly into your existing tools. If you don't, we can recommend best practices based on your environment and integration points. Either way, we keep it simple.  

You can use either the Xeeva API (SOAP, Rest), flat files, custom code, or any integration provider to make seamless connections between Xeeva and your ERP. 

At Xeeva, we understand the complexities of integrating multiple applications and can help you integrate Xeeva with your application ecosystem. To make integrating with Xeeva easier, we offer both flat file and Web API to manage the simplest to highly complex integrations. Hundreds of thousands of API transactions run through our platform each day.
        
### Format
Xeeva Integration service is capable to integrate data through synchronous (sync) and asynchronous (async) methodologies for various integration points (interfaces) web (sync/async),XML and CSV Flat file (SFTP async) and EDI(SFTP async).

At Xeeva, Integration data is bifurcated in categories master (reference) and transactional data. Example: Supplier is master data on the other hand PO, Receiving are transactional data.

Below examples of "master data" and "transactional data" are covered in more detail below.

#### Master Data InBound :

</table>

### Upcoming changes

   Roadmap is planned for:
   
   Various master data for example, users, locations, payment terms etc.
   Transactional data for example : voucher, Inventory JV, Replenishment Order etc.

## Environments
The Web API is accessible from:

https://int-**{customer code}**-stag.xeeva.com/-  **sandbox**

https://int-**{customer code}**.xeeva.com/ - **production**
    
## Authentication

To use Web API, API needs to be authenticated. Users authenticate themselves through the HTTP Header Authorization: Basic token provided by Xeeva Integration Service. If the HTTP Header is missing or if the API Key is invalid, the HTTP Response will be 401 Unauthorized.

To use SFTP: Xeeva Integration Service will provide credentials if SFTP server of Xeeva would be used. 

## Errors
    
The Web API communicates errors through standard HTTP status codes paired with error objects. 

Generally, the following pattern will apply:

 - 2xx - The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
 
 - 4xx - An error in the request. Usually a bad parameter.
 
 - 5xx - The request is fine, but something is wrong on Xeeva's end.

#### HTTP status code

 - 200 success
 
 - 201 created
 
 - 202 accepted
 
 - 204 no_content
 
 - 400 bad_request
 
 - 401 unauthorized
 
 - 403 forbidden
 
 - 404 not_found
 
 - 405 method_not_allowed
 
 - 409 conflict
 
 - 415 unsupported_media_type
 
 - 500 internal_server_error
 
 - 502 bad_gateway
 
 - 503 unavailable
 
 - 504 gateway_timeout
    
## File  (SFTP) Based Integration

#### File Based InBound Integration Process Flow 

1.  External System will be source of Business entity records.

2.  External System  will push entire data one time (at the time of first data push) to Xeeva in file to SFTP (Configured Request  Folder).

3.  Later on, External System will push only new /update Business entity records to Xeeva, incremental / delta of Business entity records transactions only.

4.  External System will send Business entity records in batches.

5.  Xeeva System will Check file format and structure of fields if not found correct, it will discard whole file.

6.  Xeeva System Performs data validation and if failed it will write failed transaction with reason in Response file.

7.  Records which are successfully validated sent for next process and failed transaction are discarded.

8.  Performs business validation and if fails, it writes failed transaction in Response file.

9.  Records which are passed successfully in business validation sent for next process and failed transaction are discarded. 

10.  Performs synchronization of data and if failed it is logged in Response file. 

11.  Xeeva System write all Response file to SFTP (Configured Response Folder).

#### File Based OutBound Integration Process Flow 

1. Xeeva System will be source of Business entity records.

2. Xeeva System  will push entire data one time (at the time of first data push) to External System  in file to SFTP (Configured Request  Folder).

3. Later on, Xeeva System  will push only new /update Business entity records to External System, incremental / delta of Business entity records transactions only.

4. Xeeva System will send Business entity records in batch.

5. External System write all Response file to SFTP (Configured Response Folder).

#### File (SFTP) Based Integration Assumptions

1. Business Entites (Supplier/Purchase Order/Receiving/Item/OkToPay)

2. SFTP (Can be setup in Xeeva internal enviornment or in External Systems enviornment.)

3. Inbound and Outbound folder structure for Request and Response files will be configured at the time of New File based integration.

## EDI (SFTP) Based  Integration

The Xeeva Dell Boomi platform Support EDI X12 standards tightly define how documents are transferred by prescribing formats, character sets, and data elements for specific industries or countries. 

The Xeeva Dell Boomi platform perform below Major tasks in EDI based integration.

1. Validating data against EDI standards

2. Acknowledging receipt and submissions of documents

3. Tracking document information for guaranteed delivery using common, secured, communication protocols.

The Xeeva Dell Boomi platform adheres to EDI industry standards while providing flexibility for B2B processes to meet the needs of your company and trading partners.
